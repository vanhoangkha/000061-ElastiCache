### Overview

- Before creating a cluster for use in production, you need to consider how you will configure the cluster to meet your needs. For this lab, you will create a cluster with **cluster mode disabled** and you will apply default configuration values.

- The cluster you create will work and not run in the sandbox. You will be charged** ElastiCache standard** usage fee for the example until you delete it. The total fee will be minimal (usually less than a dollar) if you complete the exercise described here in one go and delete your cluster when you're done.

- Your cluster is launched in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC service.
