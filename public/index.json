	"content": "If a Redis cluster (cluster mode disabled) has only one node, the node\u0026rsquo;s endpoint is used for both reading and writing. If a Redis cluster has multiple nodes, there are three types of endpoints: primary endpoint, the reader endpoint and the node endpoints.\nPrimary endpoint is the DNS name that always resolves to the primary node in the cluster. The primary endpoint is immune to changes to your cluster, such as promoting a read replica for the primary role. For write operations, you should connect your applications to the endpoint.\nThe Reader endpoint will equally divide connections to the endpoint among all read replicas in the ElastiCache for Redis cluster. Additional factors such as when an application creates connections or how an application (reuses) connections will determine traffic distribution. Reader endpoints keep up with cluster changes in real time as replicas are added or removed. You can ElastiCache for Redis cluster’s multiple read replicas in different AWS Availability Zones (AZ) to ensure high availability of reader endpoints.\nFor read operations, applications can also connect to any node in the cluster. Unlike primary endpoints, node endpoints resolve to specific endpoints. If you make changes in your cluster, such as adding or removing replicas, you must update the node endpoints in your application.\nTo find a Redis (cluster mode disabled) cluster\u0026rsquo;s endpoints Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ElastiCache console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/.\nFrom the navigation pane, select Redis clusters. The Redis clusters screen will appear with a list of Redis (cluster mode disabled) and Redis (cluster mode enabled) clusters.\nTo find the Primary and/or Reader endpoints of the cluster, select the name of the cluster.\nIf Redis (cluster mode disabled) cluster has replica nodes, you can find replica node endpoints of the cluster by selecting the name of the cluster. The nodes screen appears with each node in the cluster, primary and replicas, listed with its endpoint.\nTo copy an endpoint to your clipboard: One endpoint at a time, find and mark the endpoint you want to clone.\nRight-click the highlighted endpoint, then select Copy from the context menu.

When you create a new subnet group, note the number of available IP addresses. If the subnet group has very few available IP addresses, you may be limited in the number of nodes you can add to the cluster. To get around this, you can assign multiple subnets to a subnet group so that you have a sufficient number of IP addresses in the Availability Zone of the cluster. Thereby you can add more nodes to your cluster. Content 3.1.1 Create a subnet group using Console 3.1.2 Create a subnet group using AWS CLI "

	"content": "Overview Amazon ElastiCache is a service that makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale data storage in a distributed memory or cache environment. It provides a high-performance, scalable and cost-effective caching solution. It also eliminates the complexity involved in deploying and managing distributed cache environments.\nElastiCache for Redis has many features:\nAutomatically detect and recover from node failures. Redis (cluster mode enabled) supports partitioning your data up to 500 shards. Availability Zone locations of nodes and clusters are flexible for increased fault tolerance. Integrates with other AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon SNS, providing a high-performance and highly secure managed in-memory caching solution. ElastiCache for Redis manages backups, patching, automatic error detection and recovery. Clusters The basic component of ElastiCache for Redis is called a cluster.\nA cluster is a collection of one or more cache nodes, all running one instance of the Redis cache engine software.\nWhen you create a cluster, you specify the engine and version for all nodes to use. Your ElastiCache for Redis instances are designed to be accessible through Amazon EC2 instances. You can create and modify a cluster using the AWS CLI, ElastiCache for Redis API, or the AWS Management Console.\nEach ElastiCache for Redis cluster runs an instance of the Redis engine. Each Redis engine version has its own supported features. In addition, each Redis engine instance has a set of parameters in a parameter group that control the behavior of the clusters it manages.\nThe compute capacity and memory capacity of a cluster is determined by its instance or node or class. You can choose the type of node that best meets your needs. If your needs change over time, you can change the node type.\nYou can also take advantage of data hierarchy considering your node type needs. Data rating is a feature where some of the least-used data is stored on disk to minimize memory limitations on applications that can tolerate additional latency.\nThere are two types of node cluster storage: Standard and memory-optimized.\nThey vary in performance and price characteristics, allowing you to tailor performance and storage costs to your needs.\nYou can run a cluster on a virtual private cloud (VPC) using the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service. When you use a VPC, you have control over your virtual network environment. You can choose your own IP address range, create subnet groups, and configure routing lists and access control. ElastiCache manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection and recovery.(No extra cost to run your cluster in VPC).\nElastiCache nodes Node is the smallest building block of the ElastiCache implementation. A node can exist in isolation or in some relationship with other nodes. Node is a fixed-size piece of RAM that is attached to the network. Each node runs an instance of the engine, and the version was selected when you created your cluster. If needed, you can scale the nodes in a cluster up or down to a different instance type. Every node in a cluster is the same instance type and runs the same cache engine. Each cache node has its own Domain Name Service (DNS) port and name. ElastiCache for Redis shards A Redis shard (called a node group in the API and CLI) is a group of one to six related nodes. A Redis cluster (cluster mode disabled) always has a shard. Redis clusters (cluster mode enabled) can have up to 500 shards, with your data partitioned across shards. The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the Redis engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. Make sure there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase.

	"content": "\rAll ElastiCache clusters are designed to be accessible from an Amazon EC2 instance. The most common scenario is accessing an ElastiCache cluster from an Amazon EC2 instance in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which will be the case for this lab.\nBy default, access to your cluster is limited to the user account that was used to create it. Before you can connect to a cluster from an EC2 instance, you must allow the EC2 instance to access the cluster. The required steps depend on whether you are launching your cluster into EC2-VPC or EC2-Classic.\nThe most common use case is when an application deployed on an EC2 instance needs to connect to a cluster in the same VPC. The simplest way to manage access between EC2 instances and clusters within the same VPC is to do the following:\nCreate a Security Group VPC for your cluster. This Security Group can be used to restrict access to cluster instances. For example, you can create a custom rule for this Security Group that allows TCP access using the port you specified for the cluster when you created it and an IP address you will use to access the cluster.\nThe default port for Redis clusters and replicas group is 6379.\nTo create a rule in Security Group VPC that allows connections from another Security Group\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc.\nSelect Security Groups.\nSelect or create a security group that you will use for Cluster instances.\nIn Inbound Rules, select Edit Inbound Rules\n5. then select Add Rule. This security group will allow access to members of other security groups.\n6. For Type, select Custom TCP Rule\nFor Port Range, specify the port you used when you created your cluster.\nThe default gateway for Redis clusters and replication groups is 6379.\nIn the Source box, start entering the ID of the security group. From the list, select the security group you will use for your Amazon EC2 instances.\nSelect Save rule when you\u0026rsquo;re done. "
